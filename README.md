# Welcome to U of T Outdoors
This repository collects policy documents and other public-facing docs related to the [U of T Outdoors](http://outdoors.hackinghistory.ca/) project. At some point we may generate our website from this repo or one similar to it.  At present it is just a place to iterate on policies and documents related to the working group. 

## tools for Collaboration
We use the following tools for collaboration:
- [Slack](https://uoftoutdoors.slack.com)
- Google docs for general collaboration
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/groups/1696231/outdoor-ed-uto) for bibliographic collaboration

I (Matt) would love to add markdown-based workflow to this list. THis would include:
- Github for certain kinds of collaborative document writing
- static site generator for website work
- [Hackmd](http://hackmd.io) for meeting notes

## Other Stuff

The main reason I created this repo was to find a place for the [Code of Conduct](./CONDUCT.md).
